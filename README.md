## 本书概述

Creating top-notch software is an extremely difficult undertaking. Developers researching the subject have difficulty determining which advice is up to date and which approaches have already been replaced by easier, better practices. At the same time, most online resources offer limited explanation, while also lacking the proper context and structure.

This book offers a simpler, more comprehensive, experience as it treats the subject of building C++ solutions holistically. Modern CMake for C++ is an end-to-end guide to the automatization of complex tasks, including building, testing, and packaging. You'll not only learn how to use the CMake language in CMake projects, but also discover what makes them maintainable, elegant, and clean. The book also focuses on the structure of source directories, building targets, and packages. As you progress, you'll learn how to compile and link executables and libraries, how those processes work, and how to optimize builds in CMake for the best results. You'll understand how to use external dependencies in your project – third-party libraries, testing frameworks, program analysis tools, and documentation generators. Finally, you'll get to grips with exporting, installing, and packaging for internal and external purposes.

By the end of this book, you'll be able to use CMake confidently on a professional level.

#### 关键特性

- Understand and automate compilation and linking with CMake

- Manage internal and external dependencies easily
- Add quality checks and tests as an inherent step for your builds

#### 将会学到

- Understand best practices for building C++ code
- Gain practical knowledge of the CMake language by focusing on the most useful aspects
- Use cutting-edge tooling to guarantee code quality with the help of tests and static and dynamic analysis
- Discover how to manage, discover, download, and link dependencies with CMake
- Build solutions that can be reused and maintained in the long term
- Understand how to optimize build artifacts and the build process itself



## 适读人群

**Sergio Guidi Tabosa Pessoa** is a software engineer with more than 30 years of experience
in software development and maintenance, from complex enterprise software projects to
modern mobile applications. In the early days, he worked primarily with the Microsoft
stack, but soon discovered the power of the UNIX and Linux operating systems. Even
though he has worked with many languages over the years, C and C++ remain his favorite
languages for their power and speed.

He has a bachelor's degree in computer science and an MBA in IT management and is
always hungry to learn new technologies, break code, and learn from his mistakes. He
currently lives in Brazil with his wife, two Yorkshire Terriers, and two cockatiels.  

> First and foremost, I would like to thank all the people involved in this project, including the author for crafting such a great piece of work, and Packt Publishing for giving me this opportunity. I also would like to thank my beautiful wife, Lucia, as well as Touché and Lion, for their patience and for allowing me the time needed to help  

Holding an engineering degree from ENSEEIHT and a Ph.D. in computer science from UVSQ in France, **Eric Noulard** has been writing and compiling source code in a variety of languages for 20 years. A user of CMake since 2006, he has also been an active contributor to the project for several years. During his career, Eric has worked for private companies and government agencies. He is now employed by Antidot, a software vendor responsible for developing and marketing high-end information retrieval technology and solutions.  

**Mohammed Alqumairi** is a software engineer at Cisco Meraki with experience in developing critical and performant backend services using a variety of languages and frameworks, with a particular focus on modern C++, CMake, and the Poco libraries. Mohammed graduated with honors from City, University of London, with a B.Sc. in Computer Science.
