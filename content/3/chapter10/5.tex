\subsubsubsection{10.5.1\hspace{0.2cm}Other documentation generation utilities}

There are dozens of other tools that are not covered in this book, as we're focusing on projects supported by CMake. Nevertheless, some of them may be more appropriate for your use case. If you're feeling adventurous, visit the websites of two projects I found interesting that are listed here:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Adobe's Hyde (\url{https://github.com/adobe/hyde})

Aimed at the Clang compiler, Hyde produces Markdown files that can be consumed by tools such as Jekyll (\url{https://jekyllrb.com/}), a static page generator supported by GitHub.

\item 
Standardese (\url{https://github.com/standardese/standardese})

This uses libclang to compile your code and provides output in HTML, Markdown, LaTex, and man pages. It aims (quite boldly) to be the next Doxygen.
\end{itemize}
